**Salted caramel waffles**

Salted caramel gives these waffles a modern twist. I could eat the sauce
on its own, but it is delicious with caramel waffles and chocolate curls.
The recipe calls for vanilla salt which is available from good
delicatessens or online but if you want you can make your own at home
following the method here.

* 260 g/2 cups self-raising/rising flour, sifted

* 1 teaspoon baking powder

* 3 eggs, separated

* 375 ml/1½ cups milk

* 75 g/5 tablespoons butter, melted, plus extra for greasing

* 50 g/½ cup plain/bittersweet chocolate curls, to serve

_FOR THE SALTED CARAMEL SAUCE_

* 150 g/¾ cup caster/granulated sugar

* 100 g/7 tablespoons butter

* 1 teaspoon vanilla salt (see Note) or sea salt plus 1 teaspoon vanilla extract/vanilla bean paste

* 250 ml/1 cup double/heavy cream

* An electric or stove-top waffle iron

_Makes 8_

Begin by making the salted caramel sauce. Put the sugar and butter in a
saucepan or pot set over a medium heat and simmer until both have melted,
and the resulting caramel starts to turn a deep golden brown colour. Add
the salt and cream and whisk over the heat until the sauce is smooth and
glossy. If any lumps of sugar have formed in your sauce, strain through a
fine mesh sieve/strainer over a mixing bowl. Set aside to cool.

To make the waffle batter, put the flour, baking powder, egg yolks,
milk and melted butter in a large mixing bowl. Whisk until you have a
smooth batter. Add 80 ml/scant ⅓ cup of the caramel sauce and whisk again.
In a separate mixing bowl, whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks and then
gently fold into the batter a third at a time.

Preheat the waffle iron and grease with a little butter.

Ladle a small amount of the batter into the preheated waffle iron and
cook the waffles for 3–5 minutes until golden brown. Keep the waffles
warm while you cook the remaining batter in the same way.

Serve the waffles immediately with the caramel sauce on the side, topped
with chocolate curls.

_Note:_
To make vanilla salt, split 2 vanilla pods/vanilla beans and remove the
seeds. Cut the pods in half. Stir the vanilla seeds into several large
spoonfuls of sea salt flakes. Place the salt, seeds and vanilla
pods/vanilla beans in a sterilized airtight jar and set aside for 2 weeks.
Discard the vanilla pods/vanilla beans before using.
