**Basic Ice Cream Recipe (Ice Cream Base), approx. 18% milk fat**

During my long career at various work places and trade schools, I’ve been 
involved in making many types of ice creams, but this recipe is
my absolute favorite. This classic ice cream is also an excellent basic 
recipe that can be mixed with many flavors. If you want a lighter
ice cream, you can add less cream, but the ice cream won’t turn out as
creamy. Also be careful not to add too much fat, then the fat tends to 
crystallize and give the ice cream a grainy texture. If you don’t want to 
use gelatin sheets, you can exclude them, but the consistency is always 
better if you add them. In this recipe we use the crème anglaise method. 
In America, this type of ice cream is called double cream ice cream, the 
lighter variations are referred to as cream ice cream.

* (4g) 2 gelatin sheets

* 1-2 vanilla pods, divided and scraped

* 500 g (2 cups) milk

* 500 g (2 cups) whipping cream

* 50g (2½ tbsp) light honey or glucose syrup

* 240 g (1 cup) egg yolks

* 250 g (1¼ cups) granulated sugar

_Day 1_

1. Soak the gelatin sheets in cold water for at least 10 minutes.

2. Place the vanilla pod and the seeds in a big pan and add milk, cream,
   honey or glucose syrup.

3. Beat the yolks and sugar fluffy. Bring the cream mixture to a boil. 
   Add the warm cream blend into the frothy yolk mix, and whisk thoroughly.
   Pour everything back into the pan.

4. Heat to 185ºF while you continuously stir the ice cream blend with a 
   ladle. You will be able to tell when you reach the right temperature,
   because the mixture will start to thicken. Use a thermometer, or do a 
   rose test.

5. Lift the gelatin sheets out of the water and add to the ice cream blend.
   Stir until they have dissolved.

6. Sieve through a chinois, or a fine sieve, into a stainless steel bowl. 
   Cool the ice cream blend as quickly as possible in an ice cold water
   bath, stirring occasionally to speed up the process.

7. Cover with plastic wrap and allow the ice cream to swell for 4-12 hours,
   or preferably 24 hours, in a refrigerator at 39.2ºF.

_Day 2_

1. Mix the ice cream blend with an immersion hand blender before you 
   freeze it to get a smoother texture.
2. Pour the ice cream mass into the ice cream machine so that you fill up
   to half of the container, and freeze during continuous stirring so that 
   the ice cream gets smooth and firm. Time will vary depending on the ice 
   cream machine that you are using. If you don’t have one of those 
   machines, you can put the ice cream blend in the freezer and 
   occasionally stir it with a ladle until the ice cream is firm. Serve 
   right away.

_Remember…_

If you freeze an ice cream for too long, the texture may become strange 
and buttery, because the butter fat tends to crystallize.

**PISTACHIO ICE CREAM**

* 1 batch of the vanilla ice cream base 
* 200 g (4/5 cup) pistachio paste 
* 1 drop of orange blossom water
* 1 drop of oil of bitter almonds
* 2 cl (1½ tbsp) kirschwasser (cherry brandy), Maraschino liqueur, or rum.

Add all the ingredients to the ice cream batter. Strain through a fine 
sieve or chinois. Cool rapidly to 39.2ºF and allow the batter to sit
until the next day. Freeze the batter in an ice cream machine. When the 
ice cream is frozen, you can add 100 g (¾ cup) caramelized pistachios.
